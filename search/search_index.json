I was researching Byzantine (Eastern Roman Empire) coins at the Athenian Agora as well as how coins were curated and exhibited in Greek Museums. I focused on how the museums used coins to present and represent Byzantine identity to the public. It was no surprise to see the coins displayed in glass cases with brief explanations next to them. However, what was surprising was the stark contrast between those who visited the Numismatic Museum of Athens, the Byzantine and Christian Museum (Athens), the Museum of Byzantine Culture (Thessaloniki), and the fairly new, architecturally stunning, bright, spacious, and interactive, Acropolis Museum in Athens.  Can you guess which museum had more people present?  The Acropolis Museum. I asked myself, what was it about the Acropolis museum, besides its modernist architecture, that brought people into it by the thousands? Was it Greek antiquity? No, there were Roman exhibits, too. Why was this museum so attractive compared to the other museums? Maybe it was the public access to the excavated site underneath the museum. Were the narratives told through the exhibits more engaging, interactive, and enchanting than Byzantine history and material culture? No, it can't be. Byzantine history and archaeology are super cool...but is it enchanting? Do you even know who the Byzantines are?</p>"},{"location":"#enjoy-the-course","title":"Enjoy the Course!","text":""},{"location":"Syllabus4XXX/1.Course%20Overview/Course%20Overview/","title":"Course Overview","text":""},{"location":"Syllabus4XXX/1.Course%20Overview/Course%20Overview/#course-description","title":"Course Description:","text":"<p>This is a course about the power of narrative, knowledge creation, and the digital methods used to facilitate such endeavours to create enchantment around the archaeology of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire within the public sphere. Specifically, we will explore how narrative and knowledge is constructed around Byzantine coins from excavation to exhibition, and how museums use these coins to represent Byzantine history and identity for public consumption. The central question I want to explore in this course is: How can we make Byzantine coins more accessible and enchanting for the public?  I want us to explore this question by integrating digital methods into our analysis. However, you may be asking, why bother going through all this effort to make Byzantine coins more engaging, accessible and enchanting? A coin is a coin, right?</p> <p>Nope!</p> <p>Besides my personal bias, coins have been, and continue to be, to some degree, isolated from historical and archaeological narratives in museums. Each ancient and medieval coin is unique. They were hand-struck which makes no two coins alike. Furthermore, Byzantine coins are tangible objects that link our modern world to the ancient and medieval world as many of our modern coin designs are inspired by Greek and Roman coins (Balaskas 2019). Unfortunately, Byzantine coins have generally been presented to the public in a disenchanted manner; distant, dis-engaged, sensorially abstract, void of their primary form of engagement: Touch and Feel. The sensorial is very much removed and this distorts the affective nature Byzantine coins have on the public. We generally display coins behind glass-encased exhibits (with written descriptions either next to the coin or on panel outside of the display) forbidding the experience of touch and, in many situations, in order to see the intricate artistic, linguistic, and iconographic details you must lean in as close as possible to view the coins on display. But not too close where you set off the alarms (I did this at the Museum of Byzantine Culture in Thessaloniki). Because of the way coins are presented, inevitably, we do not see many of the finer details altogether. Is it any wonder that the monotonous, chronologically ordered, sensorily-abstract methods used to exhibit many Byzantine coins has created an aura of disenchantment. </p> <p>To address the above problems, we need to understand how Byzantine history developed as a discipline and how coins, within this disciplinary framework, are excavated, analyzed, curated, represented and presented for public consumption in museums. After which, we will explore different digital methodologies to (re)approach Byzantine coins in, I hope, a more enchanting manner. The objective of the course is to expose students, in a pedagogical environment that does not frown upon failure but openly embraces its inevitability for its learning potential, to a variety of skills and tools to critically assess the intersection of Byzantine history, archaeology, digital humanities and numismatics within public history. The goal is to provide students with the necessary skills that will allow them to critically (re)think how we engage the public with Byzantine coins in public institutions and digital spaces. Furthermore, we address these questions through collaborative digital means, but before we get into the meat of the course, you may be saying: Back that train up. What is enchantment? </p>"},{"location":"Syllabus4XXX/1.Course%20Overview/Course%20Overview/#enchantment-not-just-a-disney-fairy-tale","title":"Enchantment: Not just a Disney fairy tale.","text":"<p>Enchantment is a 'state of wonder,'' an emotive experience that is generated deliberately or by surprise through the affective nature of the sensorial experience (Bennett 2001; Perry 2006; Graham 2020). During our exploration of Byzantine history, archaeology, numismatics and public history we will note that discussion surrounding enchantment in Byzantine studies is...lacking. Why? One answer may be how archaeologists and numismatists present and discuss our respective fields. Shawn Graham writes, \u2018The serious face of archaeology we present to the public is so lifeless: how can we expect government and the public to be excited about our work if we ourselves give every indication of not being excited either?\u2019\u201d (Graham 2020: 4). In other words, unless scholars get more excited, evocative, animated, provide alternative mediums for narrative creation, create opportunities for public engagement, collaboration, and interaction, and a little less disparaging about how we represent our work to the public, we may indeed be able to create enchantment for and with the public at-large. Graham's observation is pointedly true for Byzantine coins but I am not saying (and I am sure Graham is not) that we go all Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade on the archaeology of Byzantine coins. That would require time travel. The question, rather, is what processes and mediums should be explored to facilitate enchantment around Byzantine coins and what could enchantment do for the study of Byzantine history? Enchantment, I argue, can present new, innovative and evocative affective methodologies to critically (re)engage with archaeological legacy data and contemporary materials for creating enchanting narratives that will stimulate wonder and aura around the public facing presentation of Byzantine history.</p>"},{"location":"Syllabus4XXX/1.Course%20Overview/Course%20Structure/","title":"Course Structure","text":""},{"location":"Syllabus4XXX/1.Course%20Overview/Course%20Structure/#course-structure","title":"Course Structure:","text":"<p>First, the course is designed as an intensive seminar course in order to promote intimate debate and dialogues between individuals and small working groups. Registration has been limited to nine students to facilitate three groups of three students in order to promote collaboration for the entirety of the course. The course was developed to simulate how archaeological and curatorial practices are accomplished in a variety of collaborate environments. Each week, students are expected to come prepared to class and participate in discussions about the assigned readings and podcasts. These class discussions are meant to support and stimulate students in their weekly discussion post contributions.  Week one provides a general introduction to the course, with an overview of course's overarching themes, objectives, goals and assessments. We will discuss and begin to apply Obsidian.md, a note taking manager (details provided in week one's overview), to our course objectives.</p> <p>Phase one (weeks 2 - 4) will expose students to the concepts and themes in academic history, public history, and digital humanities. Through these frameworks we will discuss the creation of Byzantine studies in the nineteenth century and the effect this had on the development of national and historical narratives for Roman and Byzantine history and identity in public spaces such as museums. We end each phase with an experiential learning tutorial where we apply what we have learned from the previous weeks into a tangible project. By the end of phase one, students should come away with a general knowledge for the development of Byzantine studies, problems associated with the terms Byzantine and Byzantine Empire, as well as how they affect identity representation. </p> <p>Phase two (weeks 5-8) begins our journey into Byzantine numismatics and the archaeology of coins. We will address the many contexts of a coin's existence and how they are excavated, documented, curated and finally placed into exhibition. Themes in cultural heritage and cultural property will be addressed along with how the label Byzantine continues to be incorporated into national historical narratives. Specifically, we explore the creation of 'medieval hellenism' in the Greek Nation-State's early development and the affects this had on narrative creation for Byzantine history. By the end of phase two, students will debate whether museums should continue to use the label Byzantine to represent the medieval Eastern Roman Empire and hypothesize alternative labels to be used in student's final projects. The experiential learning tutorial will have students explore online numismatic databases where students will consider the processes for what data to record from a coin and its archaeological context, and document their selected data into their group databases for future processing.</p> <p>The last phase (weeks 9-13) centres around digital methods and theory to (re)address how Byzantine (or what label we agree upon) coins and identity can be reinterpreted, re-imagined, and presented to the public in a more informative, inclusive and enchanting format. Phase three is where we dive into the meat and potatoes for creating digital enchantment around Byzantine coins. We explore concepts of \"agile\" objects and how the sensorial creates affective public engagement with emotive intersections to help facilitate the creation of enchantment. We discuss interpretation processes in post-data collection and narrative visualization. Furthermore, we engage with Roman and Byzantine coins in their physical state and with 3D models in order to experience the emotive differences when engaging with coins in these mediums. This leads us into the final project of the course (described in the assessments section) which will be digitally based and collaboratively produced. Week 13 will be a review and final project support week. Projects are due at the end of the week (Friday at 11:59 pm).

Why? First, [H]istory is narrative construction and storytelling that must be engaging and relatable. However, public engagement doesn't mean dumbing down scholarly research (Holtorf 2007). Therefore, I don't want to inundate you with technical jargon and scare you away (that would be counter-productive). Rather, I want to challenge you to think about how we, as historians, archaeologists, public historians, and numismatists, can reframe, narrate and make Byzantine history enchanting to the public. We will discuss complex topics without the expectation that you will know all the technical jargon. Secondly, the \"We\" is exactly what it means. We (you and I) will explore, discuss, and collaborate throughout the course. Western academia/universities are embedded with colonialist structures that have created hierarchal systems that produce power structures. The professor-student relationship is one of those structures which, in some cases, can oppress or discourage the student's ability to be creative and produce new and insightful historical narratives. I want to promote and enable a constructive learning environment that focuses on rigorous creative historical narrative construction. (My Gothic Dissertation, by Dr. Anna Williams, provides excellent examples of exploited power imbalances in academia between professor and student over and above the thesis' exploration of the Gothic literary genre.) Moreover, in this class, I am learning from you just as much as you are learning from me. </p> <p>I'm not going to lecture you for an hour and a half every class of every week, then tell you to write a paper. Rather, inspired by the book Failing Gloriously (Graham 2019), my goal is to create an environment that promotes open dialogue and allows failure to produce constructive outputs and be informative to your success as a student. Things break, and subsequently, things fail because of these breaks. Failing, or as Graham states, Fail Gloriously, is not a bad thing. Indeed, it is positive and necessary (Graham 2020: 3). I have failed - a lot - and continue to do so, but each failure is a teachable moment for success. I want you to be inquisitive, curious, and daring to try new things and methods without fear of penalty. The opportunity to fail gloriously in a constructive environment produces a learning experience for you and me. Consequently, it provides you with new methodological tools for creating historical narratives while being as academically rigorous as possible. Attempting to create digital enchantment of Byzantine coins is a collaborative effort which we all learn from. Remember, we are not trying to recreate the Big Bang theory or black holes; we are studying Byzantine coins in the public and academic sphere. Equally as dramatic but without the planet Vulcan destroying properties. We will collaborate, create, fail, and succeed together. Each week we will work and support each other as a team to achieve our objectives. Archaeological sites, museums and exhibitions are not one-person shows. They are collaboratively discussed, planned, surveyed, excavated, created and curated in order to reach an end product.

I will not force you to purchase services). Think of Obsidian as your second brain to store your thoughts, ideas, and inspirations. We will use Obsidian to develop notes together and independently and generate weekly discussions amongst our peers. By the end of the term, my goal is for us to have a significant repository of notes compiled that will allow you to think critically and creatively and inform your final project.

If the term \"Byzantine\" divides, periodizes, manipulates, colonizes and denies identities, should we not ask who is or is not included in the term \"Byzantine\" at museums? In this week's tutorial, we problematize Byzantine identity and situate how it is presented on the public-facing side of museum websites.

Our first reading, Philip Grierson's Byzantine Coinage, is meant to supplement our discussion on terminologies, typologies and methods and demonstrate how coins have been traditionally studied. I don't expect you to read the whole book (think back to our strategic reading and note-taking discussion). Instead, we will pay particular attention to and discuss these methodological approaches' possible effects on constructing historical narratives with coins. Kris Lockyear notes that there is a \"remarkable lack of standardisation (sic), both in the cataloguing of the finds and in their analysis\" (Lockyear 2007). Considering Lockyear's comment, how does the lack of standardization impact how coins are identified, dated, and used for dating archaeological sites? Is it enough to catalogue coins in separate analyses? What are the consequences of the isolated studies of numismatic evidence from other material cultures recovered from archaeological sites? We will consider Dr. Tine Rassalle's approach to the analysis of coins collected from synagogues in Israel against Grierson and Lockyear's methods in order to contextualize the evolving methodologies and how this data can be transferred into meaningful and engaging narratives for public consumption (Rassalle 2021). Lastly, in Fleur Kemmers and Nanouschka Myrberg's Rethinking Numismatics (A personal favourite), the authors demonstrate that coins are more than just mediums for typology, periodization, and tools for dating archaeological sites. They present an argument for coin agency, which is imposed onto the coin by the individual studying it (research questions, educational background or how they are trained) and, more importantly, how a coin has an agency which affects the \"person\" who is in possession of a coin.</p>"},{"location":"Syllabus4XXX/2.Course%20Calendar/Week%205/#readings","title":"Readings:","text":"<p>Rassalle, Tine. 2021   Coins and how to properly excavate, publish, and read them - Ancient Synagogue Coins.

As we saw in the previous weeks, the Byzantine Empire and its identity are contentious historical constructions rooted in imperialist, nationalist and orientalist discourse. These constructed identities inevitably create problems for historians and archaeologists to understand how the \"Byzantines\" perceived their own identities through the material culture they produced. Numismatics is no exception to these issues and is problematized more by the field's lack of standardization and antiquarian-based methods from its formation during the eighteenth and into the early twentieth century. However, over the past three decades, scholars have been more cognitive about integrating coins into archaeological and historical discourse, but can they provide tangible evidence for how people identified in the eastern Roman world? Considering Walter Pohl's question, we will discuss how interdisciplinary methods are \"fundamentally inherent\" in Byzantine studies (Veikou 2022: 236) and if interdisciplinary approaches can aid and diversify numismatic research.  We also discuss if a coin is an artifact, historical document or both, and how this affects our analysis of coins (Hedrick Jr 2006).

Coin analysis is complex, and when we consider the variety of contexts a coin circulates through (Kemmers and Myrberg 2011), the identities of those who resided where a coin was deposited in the archaeological record cannot be easily equated with the coin itself. The readings for this class present us with further considerations with respect to analyzing coins from archaeological contexts. The purpose for problematizing archaeological and numismatic analysis is to highlight that umbrella terms, like \"Byzantine\", cannot provide scholars, nor the public, with a complete understanding of a coin's relationship with its past.  Furthermore, we will consider how each author navigates the complexities of identity when analyzing coins. Motta (2015), presents us with a variety of Greek and Roman iconography on coins recovered from the ancient port city of Dora and how identities were nuanced in border regions of the Roman world. Julian Baker's (2020) article forces us to think about the identities of those who create, distribute, and use coins in the late medieval period of Byzantine Greece. Here we compare how to extract identity from coins that are counterfeited, clipped, and remained in circulation for a century or more. Lastly, Lockyear's (2012) article presents us with the conundrum of dating coins and dating with coins. Reflecting on Baker's analysis, how can we use coins to date archaeological sites if they remained in circulation for over a century? Can we trust a counterfeit coin's supposed minting date and how does this affect our interpretations for dating stratigraphic contexts?  By the end of the class, we should be good and confused about how to attribute identities to coins (but not in a bad way). Thus, by problematizing the identities associated with coins, chronologically, spatially, and temporally, we end this class by asking whose heritage do Byzantine coins represent and are coins cultural property to the modern Nation-State?</p>"},{"location":"Syllabus4XXX/2.Course%20Calendar/Week%206/#readings","title":"Readings:","text":"<p>Motta, Rosa Maria. 2015   The Iconography of Dora's Coins.

The objective for this class is to force you to think about ethical issues that surround moveable (coins) and non-moveable (an archaeological site) material culture. Since coins are moveable objects both in the past and the present, and have crossed ancient, medieval and modern temporal and geographical borders, who can claim ownership of a coin?  Can a Nation, institution or individual own Byzantine coins? How does this affect the presentation of a \"Byzantine\" coin compared to a \"Roman\" or \"Greek\" coin to the public? How does this impact the identities associated to a coin and, thus, effects whose heritage is represented in a museum?

This week we focus on where Byzantine archaeology and history are performed, represented and presented to the public in nationally operated and funded institutions.  We draw from the themes we teased out from the previous class to assess the development of national museums in Greece and the insertion of \"Byzantine\" narratives into these public spaces. We begin by asking if archaeologists can objectively research ancient identities when funded by national organizations and institutions (Curta 2021). We follow with a discussion on \"The Colonial Origins of National Archaeologies\" and how a Greek national identity was formed, the effect this had on public perception of the past, and how this \"resurrection\" and the \"rebirth of Hellas\" (Greenberg and Hamilakis 2022), informed Greek national discourse which utilized Byzantium to link ancient Greek identities to modern Greece (Christodoulou 2012).

Visitors are also Heritage-making, but what does this mean? How do we make heritage? Who is making heritage or heritage claims? In other words, who provides the material culture and the associated narratives that will influence heritage-making? How does the curator choose what is deemed more significant, more important, and more enchanting than other forms of material culture (say, the Parthenon marbles versus bronze Byzantine coins), and how do these choices affect public heritage-making?

How does this affect the public experience with the past, archaeological and historical narratives, and the construction of heritage-meaning to the individual? Cornelius Holtorf notes a disconnect between academic archaeology and public inclusion in archaeology, as motives do not necessarily align (Holftorf 2007). We can push Holtorf's observation further and into the museum realm. What is intriguing for the public versus what the museum believes to be significant can differ on many levels.  Engagement with objects is one of these disconnects where public and academic alignment do not agree.  Therefore, we will explore the above questions and discuss the possible implications of allowing the public to engage and interact with ancient coins beyond the traditional visual exhibit that promotes a no-touchy policy.  We discuss the Pack It Up! project and how 'experiential abundance' leads to more evocative engagement, or enchantment, of material culture, narrative, and heritage interpretation (Zinn 2022). The agility of objects (German and Harris 2017) provides an opportunity for museums and the public to learn from each other and create learning experiences that can re-imagine what heritage interpretation is and means to the public. What criteria need to be considered in order to choose objects that can be \"agile\" and moved beyond their protective case/vault to be touched, felt, seen up close, and exchanged by the public? Should it be aesthetically pleasing to the eye? Beautiful? Or publicly informative yet, scholarly disposable?

The tutorial's goal is to provide students with the necessary skills to navigate large databases, interpret legacy data and provide data for their group's final project. </p> <p>The final tutorial's objective (Week 12) is to support students and their data analysis. In other words, how to synthesize the data collected in week eight into a readable and useable narrative for museum curators to draw from when creating museum coin exhibits. Students play both roles, as the tutorial's goal is to simulate the dialogues between scholars when creating historical narratives for public consumption. Students will draw from their group's Obsidian notes to support their analysis and the final project. </p>"},{"location":"Syllabus4XXX/4.Hist4XXXTemplates/BioTemplate/","title":"BioTemplate","text":"<p>&lt;%*   let title = tp.file.title   if (title.startsWith(\"Untitled\")) {     title = await tp.system.prompt(\"Title\");     await tp.file.rename(title);   } </p> <p>tR += \"---\" %&gt; title:  &lt;%* tR += title %&gt; Tags: Type: BioNote</p>"},{"location":"Syllabus4XXX/4.Hist4XXXTemplates/BioTemplate/#do-not-alter-the-above-code","title":"Do Not Alter the Above Code","text":"<p>*Created: &lt;% tp.date.now(\"Do MMMM YYYY\") %&gt; Last modified: &lt;% tp.file.last_modified_date(\"Do MMMM YYYY\") %&gt;</p> <p>Name:   Insert name in double brackets (Put pronouns in brackets [Optional])  tags: tag1, Use hashtag (#) initials. i.e. #SC for Scott Coleman Project: [[Hist4xxx]] </p>"},{"location":"Syllabus4XXX/4.Hist4XXXTemplates/BioTemplate/#bio-tell-us-about-you","title":"Bio: Tell us about you","text":"<p>Help me and your peers get to know you better.
