## Course Structure: 

![[StoaOfAttalos.jpeg]]

First, the course is designed as an intensive seminar course in order to promote intimate debate and dialogues between individuals and small working groups. Registration has been limited to nine students to facilitate three groups of three students in order to promote collaboration for the entirety of the course. The course was developed to simulate how archaeological and curatorial practices are accomplished in a variety of collaborate environments. Each week, students are expected to come prepared to class and participate in discussions about the assigned readings and podcasts. These class discussions are meant to support and stimulate students in their weekly discussion post contributions.  Week one provides a general introduction to the course, with an overview of course's overarching themes, objectives, goals and assessments. We will discuss and begin to apply *Obsidian.md*, a note taking manager (details provided in week one's overview), to our course objectives.

Phase one (weeks 2 - 4) will expose students to the concepts and themes in academic history, public history, and digital humanities. Through these frameworks we will discuss the creation of Byzantine studies in the nineteenth century and the effect this had on the development of national and historical narratives for Roman and Byzantine history and identity in public spaces such as museums. We end each phase with an experiential learning tutorial where we apply what we have learned from the previous weeks into a tangible project. By the end of phase one, students should come away with a general knowledge for the development of Byzantine studies, problems associated with the terms Byzantine and Byzantine Empire, as well as how they affect identity representation. 

Phase two (weeks 5-8) begins our journey into Byzantine numismatics and the archaeology of coins. We will address the many contexts of a coin's existence and how they are excavated, documented, curated and finally placed into exhibition. Themes in cultural heritage and cultural property will be addressed along with how the label Byzantine continues to be incorporated into national historical narratives. Specifically, we explore the creation of 'medieval hellenism' in the Greek Nation-State's early development and the affects this had on narrative creation for Byzantine history. By the end of phase two, students will debate whether museums should continue to use the label Byzantine to represent the medieval Eastern Roman Empire and hypothesize alternative labels to be used in student's final projects. The experiential learning tutorial will have students explore online numismatic databases where students will consider the processes for what data to record from a coin and its archaeological context, and document their selected data into their group databases for future processing.

The last phase (weeks 9-13) centres around digital methods and theory to (re)address how Byzantine (or what label we agree upon) coins and identity can be reinterpreted, re-imagined, and presented to the public in a more informative, inclusive and enchanting format. Phase three is where we dive into the meat and potatoes for creating digital enchantment around Byzantine coins. We explore concepts of "agile" objects and how the sensorial creates affective public engagement with emotive intersections to help facilitate the creation of enchantment. We discuss interpretation processes in post-data collection and narrative visualization. Furthermore, we engage with Roman and Byzantine coins in their physical state and with 3D models in order to experience the emotive differences when engaging with coins in these mediums. This leads us into the final project of the course (described in the assessments section) which will be digitally based and collaboratively produced. Week 13 will be a review and final project support week. Projects are due at the end of the week (Friday at 11:59 pm). See Assessments section for due dates and grading breakdown.

### Course Expectations:

1) Complete assigned weekly readings.

2) Come prepared to discuss readings for each class.

3) Participate in discussion posts.

4) Participate and collaborate in class tutorials.

5) Submit a final digital project.

### Learning Outcomes:

1) Discuss and contextualize the development of Byzantine Studies as a discipline. 

2) Conduct independent research on Byzantine history and identity.

3) Analyze, evaluate and identify Byzantine coins.

4) Identify cultural heritage and ethical issues concerning material culture.

5) Prepare and create a public-facing project utilizing the digital methods and tools discussed throughout the course. 

### Your Success:

Your success in this class is dependent on three principles:

1) **Come Prepared**. Do the readings, be prepared to discuss and collaborate with me and your peers. Each class is designed to explore and discuss the assigned readings and podcasts, and how they can inform our research objectives and goals. I will not be lecturing for an hour and a half each class. But I might nerd out and gab your ear off. 

2) **Be Fearless**. Despite what Yoda might think: "Do, or do not. There is no try." (Starwars, Episode V), I want you to **try** new tools and venture into the swampy unknown. 

3) **Fail Gloriously**. Words I live by now. Do not be afraid to fail. When we **try** new methods, theories and digital tools, we are bound to mess up, break things, and fail. If "we" fail, then "we" have learned something.
