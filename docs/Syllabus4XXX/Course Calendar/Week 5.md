### Byzantine Archaeology and Numismatics.

#### Numismatics and Archaeology.
We begin with an overview of the basic terminologies and methods in archaeology and numismatics. Our first reading, Philip Grierson's *Byzantine Coinage*, is meant to supplement our discussion on terminologies, typologies and methods and demonstrate how coins have been traditionally studied. I don't expect you to read the whole book (think back to our strategic reading and note-taking discussion). Instead, we will pay particular attention to and discuss these methodological approaches' possible effects on constructing historical narratives with coins. Kris Lockyear notes that there is a "remarkable lack of standardisation (sic), both in the cataloguing of the finds and in their analysis" (Lockyear 2007). Considering Lockyear's comment, how does the lack of standardization impact how coins are identified, dated, and used for dating archaeological sites? Is it enough to catalogue coins in separate analyses? What are the consequences of the isolated studies of numismatic evidence from other material cultures recovered from archaeological sites? We will consider Dr. Tine Rassalle's approach to the analysis of coins collected from synagogues in Israel against Grierson and Lockyear's methods in order to contextualize the evolving methodologies and how this data can be transferred into meaningful and engaging narratives for public consumption (Rassalle 2021). Lastly, in Fleur Kemmers and Nanouschka Myrberg's *Rethinking Numismatics* (A personal favourite), the authors demonstrate that coins are more than just mediums for typology, periodization, and tools for dating archaeological sites. They present an argument for coin agency, which is imposed onto the coin by the individual studying it (research questions, educational background or how they are trained) and, more importantly, how a coin has an agency which affects the "person" who is in possession of a coin.

#### Constructing Byzantine Narratives of Identity from Coins. 

Can there "be an 'archaeology' of identity, and if so, what does it look like (Pohl 2010)? As we saw in the previous weeks, the Byzantine Empire and its identity are contentious historical constructions rooted in imperialist, nationalist and orientalist discourse. These constructed identities inevitably create problems for historians and archaeologists to understand how the "Byzantines" perceived their own identities through the material culture they produced. Numismatics is no exception to these issues and is problematized more by the field's lack of standardization and antiquarian-based methods from its formation during the eighteenth and into the early twentieth century. However, over the past three decades, scholars have been more cognitive about integrating coins into archaeological and historical discourse, but can they provide tangible evidence for how people identified in the eastern Roman world? Considering Walter Pohl's question, we will discuss how interdisciplinary methods are "fundamentally inherent" in Byzantine studies (Veikou 2022: 236) and if interdisciplinary approaches can aid and diversify numismatic research.  We also discuss if a coin is an artifact, historical document or both, and how this affects our analysis of coins (Hedrick Jr 2006). We end the class by exploring Andrei Gândilă's (2018), '*Reconciling the 'step sisters'*, and consider if the author uses Byzantine coins in one of the approaches discussed by Veikou (2022).

#### Discussion:

Reflecting on this week's themes and last week's tutorial, I want you to explore the database from one of the largest Byzantine coin collections in the world held at Dumbarton Oaks. Choose three coins from different centuries and discuss how identity is attributed to the coins. Create individual notes for each coin from the [[DOTemplate]] and then insert the notes onto your group's Canvas mind map. Fill out all the fields in the template. There is a section for you to add your personal observations.  **Make sure to cite your sources and reply to two different discussion posts from classmates who are not in your group. **
