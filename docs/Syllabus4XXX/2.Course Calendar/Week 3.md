### Situating Byzantium:  

#### Creating Byzantium in the 19th century.

In short, the Byzantines were Romans (Romaioi) who lived within the ever-fluctuating borders of the Eastern Roman Empire (_Rhōmania_ or Romanland). This is an oversimplified answer, of course. Thus, in week three, our objective is to situate how the labels "Byzantium" and "Byzantine" came into common usage in modern scholarship and the effects on how scholars study medieval Roman identity. In other words, what do we mean when we use the labels Byzantium and Byzantine? What impact do these terms have on our historical and archaeological understandings of the Eastern Roman Empire? We first discuss why the discipline was invented (Aschenbrenner and Ransohoff, 2021) and the possible impacts the discipline's formation had on public understanding of Roman history. We also explore Shephard (2019), Bintliff (2012) and Bellinger (1966) and how historians, archaeologists and numismatists, respectively, periodize Roman history from Byzantine history.  This week's podcast is meant to supplement the inconsistencies in how Byzantine history is periodized.

#### Orientalism: Byzantium as the "other." 

In this class, we will explore and discuss the implications of orientalism, both past and present, on Byzantine studies. Specifically, how the label Byzantium establishes and encourages tropes about the eastern Roman world and what are the dangers? We first briefly touch on Edward Said's book *Orientalism* and discuss the "othering" of the near and far East by primarily western European institutions within the imagined European community (Anderson 2016). Next, we move into Anthony Kaldellis' book *Romanland* and what the author coins (pun intended) as the *substance* of the term(s) Byzantine/Byzantium (Kaldellis 2019) and explore the specificities of Roman denialism in western historical thinking. Furthermore, how Byzantium becomes synonymous with Greek and the need to create disciplinary boundaries (Kaldellis 2021). We draw from last week's readings on the construction of Byzantium as a discipline (or imagined community?) and discuss the implications of denying Roman identity to the so-called Byzantines. We will conclude with a discussion on *Is Byzantinism an Orientalism?* and how the "substance" of the label Byzantine creates the "Byzantine Subaltern" and erases identity.

#### Discussion:

Reflecting on this week's themes, I want you to respond to Paul Stephenson's question in his Introduction to *The Byzantine World*: "Why concern ourselves with the Byzantine world?" (Stephenson 2012: xxi). I want you to think about the implications the term Byzantine may have on how the public consumes Byzantine history and those who lived within the 1100-year disciplinary framework which was created.
