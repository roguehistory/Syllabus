# Week Two
# Performing Academic, Public, and Digital History: 
![[SS_CanvasSample.png]]


Before we can address the issues surrounding the enchantment of Byzantine archaeology and coins in the public sphere (museums, public media, books, podcasts, and the internet), we first need to explore what academic history, public history and the digital humanities are and where they are performed. I doing so, the goal is inform our exploration of enchantment and how we can create digital enchantment around Byzantine coins. Therefore, for our first class this week, we will explore the questions: What is academic history, public history and digital humanities (DH) and what are the differences between these fields? Is academic history a public history or vice versa? How does digital humanities contribute to these fields? Can digital humanities provide a deeper knowledge of the past? 

#### Academic History, Public History and the Past. 

The first class of the week we will ask what *is* the "Past" and what *is* "History"? David Dean notes, “Public history deals with the ways in which the past is created and presented in the public arena as history...[it] is about the ways in which the public engages with the past and about how the past is represented to the public” (Dean 2018: 2). So, if public history examines evidence from the "past" to create "history" for the present and future, then what is the public engaging with? Does the public engage with the past or a constructed historical narrative? Does this matter? What mediums are used to present the past as narrative to the public? We will address the above questions through the following works: David Deans "Introduction," in _A Companion to Public History_, Charles Hedrick Jr., "Monuments and Documents," and Michel-RolphTrouillot, "The Power in a Story."  We will discuss how each author defines 'History' and the 'Past' and the implications of these definitions on presenting History to the public.

#### Performing a "Public" History in a Digital World. 

Our second class this week addresses issues surrounding public history performance and what does it mean to perform public history digitally?  We will insert Byzantine history into this dialogue and ask is there a difference between the academic and public performance of Byzantine history and how can/does digital humanities intersect, connect and collaborate with the two. Who determines what histories are "performed" within the public sphere and what is "of value to the public" (Dean 2018)?  What digital methods are academic? rigorous? Acceptable to be used under the framework of digital humanities? To aid us in navigating these questions we first discuss Roopika Risam's introductory chapter in *New Digital Worlds* and explore the framework which constitutes digital humanities. We then move onto Alison Landsbery book *Engaging the Past* and explore how the past is represented as [H]istory in television dramas. In particular, we will focus the HBO series *Rome* and how historical narrative is performed. I want us to consider if television series like *Rome*, *Deadwood,* and *Vikings* constitute a public history? And if so, given the how the digital provides ease of access to these series, do these shows fall within the praxis of digital public history? In our last reading, we discuss Darryl McIntyre's chapter "Creating New Pasts in Museums" and the process of changing, creating and performing history in the museum. Do museums create time/space compression in their exhibits and what affects does this have on our reception and perception of history and the past?

#### Discussion:

For your first analytical discussion post, I want you to discuss what you believe digital humanities is and how it can contribute to our knowledge of the past. Is DH an analytical tool to be used by historians, archaeologists, numismatists, and public historians? Or is it a discipline in itself that creates intersections between disciplines, or removes disciplinary boundaries that create a more inclusive academic and public historical discourse?
