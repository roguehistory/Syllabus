## **Applying Numismatics: Digital Data Collecting.**

![[NickleCoins.jpeg]]


Reflecting on what we have learned thus far, this week, we will explore online numismatic databases together and discuss how they represent and present Byzantine coins. Think about these sites' language, the images displayed, how the coins are periodized, their iconography, and what historical narratives, if any, are told with the coins. Think back about the various ways coins are documented after excavation and look to see if you can find similarities or contrasts. Thinking ahead, in order for us to create enchantment around Byzantine coins, we first need to collect and analyze the data available and re-imagine how to present coins to the public. Coins are not thrown into a display or exhibit, nor are they recorded into a database and displayed on a webpage haphazardly. There is intention, but that intent is varied from site to site, exhibit to exhibit. Moreover, data and evidence must be assessed, considered, compared, and presented in a manner that allows narratives to be created. Therefore, this week, we are excavating digital data to aid us in considering a new label for "Byzantine" coins, which you will use in your final project.

#### Deliverable:

Using Google sheets, each student will document fifteen coins from the fourth to the fifteenth centuries and think about what data/evidence is or is not "significant" in order to support your research question for your final project. This tutorial is about the **PROCESS** of utilizing what you have learned to this point and critically thinking through your research questions and how to assess online/digital databases. You will need to create a data set of fifteen coins to be used by you and your classmates, so think carefully about how you record and label your data. Furthermore, you will need to document your thinking, processes and reasoning for choosing the data you selected via the [[Process Note]] template. Be as detailed and concise as possible. Think about why you choose particular identifiers to describe the coins. Refer to this week's readings and how the authors discuss capturing and documenting data. I have provided four websites for you to draw from. Remember to cite the sources and use hyperlinks to link your data to appropriate sites. Don't stress; we will work through the processes together during both classes.

#### Google Sheets Tutorials:

Below are four videos I have used to learn some of Google Sheets functionality. Some discuss basic functionality while others demonstrate more complex formulas. You may have better resources then these, and if you do, please share them with the class via our Obsidian vault in the Resource file. Place the hashtag #GoogleSheets  and your initials #SC next to the resource/links you provided.

#### Discussion: 

Reflect on the process of collecting data from this week's tutorial. What were some of the difficulties you encountered and what surprised you about the data you found from the websites? Remember to link your thoughts with your peers, as they may have solutions or alternative perspectives related to your experiences. 

**Make sure to cite your sources and reply to two different discussion posts from classmates who are not in your group.**
