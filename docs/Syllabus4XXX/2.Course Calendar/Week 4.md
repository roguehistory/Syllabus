# Tutorial One

## **Byzantine and Roman? Problematizing Byzantium on the Web.**

![[NickleRoman.jpeg]]

*"Traditional academic work is often hidden behind subscription-only paywalls or written in the jargony language of the academy; [Douglas] Galbi's (and his fellow travellers’) posts, by contrast, are freely and widely available on the internet and written in a plain and easily accessible style. It is almost certain, therefore, that their works have a larger audience than all but the most successful of their scholarly sources" (Goldwyn 2022: 428).*

Adam Goldwyn is speaking about the public-facing side of Byzantine history and how alt-right groups are using and manipulating the Christian identity of Byzantium for their ideological goals. Goldwyn's chapter also speaks to the "othering" of Byzantine identity. That is, who is and is not included based on ideological motives. Do scholars create impenetrable barriers that the public can not break through, leading the public to search for alternatives, or does the ambiguity of "Byzantine" allow for identity manipulation? If the term "Byzantine" divides, periodizes, manipulates, colonizes and denies identities, should we not ask who is or is not included in the term "Byzantine" at museums? In this week's tutorial, we problematize Byzantine identity and situate how it is presented on the public-facing side of museum websites. We will excavate identities from four museum websites and explore how museums create identity categories. Who is Byzantine? Who is Roman? Who is "Other"? 

The four museums are the Byzantine and Christian Museum (BCM) in Athens, the Numismatic Museum (NM) in Athens, the Museum of Byzantine Culture (MBC) in Thessaloniki and the Acropolis Museum in Athens. We will discuss the differences in how the museums present Byzantine History through, if available, the museum's virtual tours, permanent online exhibitions, and material culture databases.  The objective of this tutorial is to get a sense of how Byzantine history and identity are presented to the 'digital' public via the web and begin brainstorming ideas to re-imagine the storytelling of Byzantine history to the public. 

#### Deliverable:
Critically assess and document each museum's webpage and consider how we might re-imagine the public-facing presentation of Byzantine history on the web. How are the museums presenting and narrating "Byzantine" identity to the public? Use the discussion note template to record your observations, and remember to cite the museums with [Hyperlinks](https://www.byzantinemuseum.gr/en/) to the relevant page. Contemplate who is the target audience of each museum. When your discussion note is completed, insert it into your group's Obsidian mind-map tool, Canvas (We will review this tool at the beginning of the week). Next, record and discuss the processes you and your group engaged with to create your mind map in a [[Process Note]] for this tutorial. What were some of this tutorial's challenges and successes? Link your thoughts to other individuals from other groups. By the end of the week, your group should have a mind map with all your discussion posts that can be added to and evolve over the coming weeks. 

## **This project is separate from your weekly discussion post. Therefore, by the end of the week, you will have completed one tutorial discussion post, a Process Note and one weekly discussion post.**

#### Discussion:
For this week's discussion post, choose two non-museum websites (NOT WIKIPEDIA) that present Byzantium and Byzantine identity to the public. Search the web and link the sites in your discussion post. Compare the language and imagery used on these websites to those from the museums we explored this week and discuss if the information available on these sites is more publicly accessible and consumable than the information from the museums. Who are the websites' target audiences?  How do they use, if at all, any historical and archaeological evidence? Below are two sources to briefly skim over to get some website ideas.
