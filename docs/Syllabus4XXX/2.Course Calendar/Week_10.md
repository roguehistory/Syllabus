# **Is Enchantment Created or Stimulated?**

### **Agile Objects and Visitor Engagement.**

What happens when the public is "allowed" to touch an object (material culture) in a museum? How does this affect the public experience with the past, archaeological and historical narratives, and the construction of heritage-meaning to the individual? Cornelius Holtorf notes a disconnect between academic archaeology and public inclusion in archaeology, as motives do not necessarily align (Holftorf 2007). We can push Holtorf's observation further and into the museum realm. What is intriguing for the public versus what the museum believes to be significant can differ on many levels.  Engagement with objects is one of these disconnects where public and academic alignment do not agree.  Therefore, we will explore the above questions and discuss the possible implications of allowing the public to engage and interact with ancient coins beyond the traditional visual exhibit that promotes a no-touchy policy.  We discuss the *Pack It Up!* project and how 'experiential abundance' leads to more evocative engagement, or enchantment, of material culture, narrative, and heritage interpretation (Zinn 2022). The agility of objects (German and Harris 2017) provides an opportunity for museums and the public to learn from each other and create learning experiences that can re-imagine what heritage interpretation is and means to the public. What criteria need to be considered in order to choose objects that can be "agile" and moved beyond their protective case/vault to be touched, felt, seen up close, and exchanged by the public? Should it be aesthetically pleasing to the eye? Beautiful? Or publicly informative yet, scholarly disposable? Should museums play the role of gatekeeper to material culture?

### **Enchanting the Senses: Coins and the Sensorial:**

"This is an overwhelming amount of coinage, which in sheer quantity represents a collection comparable to many in the numismatic museums of the world. *Unfortunately very few of the Agora coins are museum pieces, but lamentable as is their general condition to the eye of the coin collector or the cataloguer* (emphasis added), they do provide for the historian an invaluable record of the money circulating in one of the chief cities of antiquity from the time of Sulla to our own present" (Thompson 1954: v).

For this class, we will be performing a sensorial exercise. Reflecting on the concepts from the previous class on agile objects, visitor interaction and engagement with artifacts, and re-imagining how heritage interpretation is performed. We will reflect on Russel Staiff's overview of Western responses to 'beauty' and consider how 'pretty' objects are used to construct museum narratives. For this class, I will provide coins from my personal collection for you to experience. Your objective is to document your sensorial experiences with these coins and compare them to how you have experienced numismatics in this class thus far. You are to record any and all sensorial experiences. Refer to the readings and think about how the authors discuss sensorial experiences and how it informs your knowledge of the past. You are to take all the information collected from the class and document it in your discussion post.

#### Discussion:

Thinking about this week's classes, answer the following questions: 1) Did you feel enchanted by the coins and did touching and interacting with the coins enhance your experience learning about the past? Why or why not? 2) What risks are involved when using material culture for pedagogical exercises? 3) Explain what you thought was 'beautiful' about the objects and the experiences. How will this inform your re-imagining of heritage interpretation and stimulating enchantment around coins? 4) If museums are the "gatekeepers" of material culture, can they be trusted to be objective with historical representations? 5)Think back to week six's discussion on heritage and cultural property, and discuss if you changed your mind about the ownership of private coin collections. What if it promotes knowledge creation and enchantment?
