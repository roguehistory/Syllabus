### **Visualizing Digital Enchantment.**

What does digital visualization mean, and can it be enchanting? How do we relay the enchantment of the archaeological record into a digital enchantment? What effect does digital visualization, compared to physical interaction, have on the public's emotive experience with material culture? As we approach the end of the course, it is time we start thinking about how to begin the process of creating digital narratives for our final projects. We will engage with visual representations of the past through two public-facing, but with very different business models, SketchFab and Global Digital Heritage. These two platforms are excellent sources to explore how 3D models are used to present ancient material culture to the public. 

The week's first class will be dedicated to the readings, situating how data becomes visual representations and narratives and considering the power dynamics behind visuality and the gaze (Staiff 2014). We consider the differences between aesthetic qualities in digital objects versus physical coins and affective practices to develop strategies for creating enchantment around coins (Perry 2019). What types of meta-data should be included in the creation of 3D models of coins, and how to synthesize complex processes into meaningful and informative digital visualizations for scholars and the public (Hess et al., 2018; Sopracasa et al., 2020)? Furthermore, think back to the museums we explored earlier in the semester and compare the differences between the interfaces and the ability to interact with the coins to this week's exercise (Gortana et al., 2018). How do these differences inform your strategies for developing an inclusive and engaging visual exhibit? In the following class, we will interact with a few 3D and 2D Digital visualizations of coins and compare this experience to last week's sensorial exercise. Reflect on your data collection from week eight, and consider how we can incorporate big databases into more engaging and interactive visual databases.

#### Discussion:

Click on [[3D Model Roman Coin]] and play around with the two 3D models of Roman coins. Discuss the positives and negatives of 3D coin models to represent Roman identities. Furthermore, discuss and  compare your experience with the 3D coins with those you handled in week ten. Did one experience provide a more evocative and emotive experience? Did the 3D coins create a feeling of enchantment? 
**Make sure to cite your sources and reply to two different discussion posts from classmates who are not in your group.**
