### **The Enchantment of Museums?** 

The theme for this class is drawn from the "Introduction" of Laurajane Smith's (2020) book *Emotional Heritage*. It is necessary to ask ourselves why we (the public) visit museums and what our expectations are. Smith notes two possible reasons: To learn and to recreate (a theme that reappears from our week two classes).  Smith also notes it is more complicated than just learning and recreating. Visitors are also Heritage-making, but what does this mean? How do we make heritage? Who is making heritage or heritage claims? In other words, who provides the material culture and the associated narratives that will influence heritage-making? How does the curator choose what is deemed more significant, more important, and more enchanting than other forms of material culture (say, the Parthenon marbles versus bronze Byzantine coins), and how do these choices affect public heritage-making? And, lastly, can we trust museums to provide objective exhibitory displays of the past?  Is objectivity in a National museum even possible?

### **Museums as Erasure: Museums and the Subaltern.** 

Do museums erase identities in order to allow historical narratives to be more consumable by the public? This week we discuss how to allow the subaltern to speak in museums. We will explore the concept of the subaltern (Spivak 2010), "third spaces" (Hall 2013) and the colonial presence that continues to make the "other" difficult to witness in museums (Pieterse 1997). How can we extract the voices silenced by the label "Byzantine," and what process can be implemented to excavate the subaltern voices who used the coins exhibited in museums? Do the repetitious display of coins behind cabinets and glass create power dynamics which promote authority and erase identities?

#### Discussion:

For this week's discussion, we explore *The Coin Cabinet* of [PalazzoBlu](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/PalazzoBlu/) an online Museum/exhibition that uses Reflective Transformation Imaging to engage public interaction with the museum's online coin collections. Considering this week's readings, you need to reflect on digital methods to present the past and consider who the audience is for this particular collection.  I want you to select a coin from the museum's collection and describe it. What do you see and how would you interpret the coin's "History"?  The objective is for you to provide your own interpretation of the coin and think critically about what information you think is important to include in your description of the coin for public consumption.  Don't worry about technical jargon. If you know it, use it; if you don't, I want you to use your own words. We will compare the languages used at the beginning of our next class. Use this template [[DiscussionTemplate]] to describe your coin **with the hashtag**  #PalazzoBlu.
