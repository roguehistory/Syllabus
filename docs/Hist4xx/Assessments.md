## Assessments: 
### Overview:
The course will be evaluated on participation, weekly discussion posts using Obsidian.md, three tutorial assignments (Weeks 4, 8, and 12), and a final project where students, in their designated groups, will create a virtual/digital essay with Mural.io. The tutorial assessments will focus on the process, not the outcome, while the final assignment focuses on the process and the end product. Your weekly discussion posts are meant to inform your tutorials and final project through collaborative processes with your fellow students. There is no final exam or mid-term. 

### Grading:

##### Participation: 10%
Constructive participation in class is what I am looking for. Come prepared, discuss readings and podcasts, and voila, you've participated. 

##### Discussion Posts: 30%
Discussions posts will be evaluated based on 1) the quality and clarity of content, 2) a minimum of two replies each week, 3) how you are linking your ideas, 4) citation requirements, and 5) your group's Canvas mind map. Each week is worth 2.5% of the total grade. 

##### Tutorials: 30%
Each tutorial is worth 10% of your total mark for a total of 30%.

##### Final Project: 30%
The final project will be evaluated on both individual and group criteria. 10% based on your individual contribution to the final project. 10% on the project's content and 10% based on the presentation of the project by your group. 

### Discussion Posts: 

In archaeological fieldwork, teams of individuals excavate designated trenches that may contain material culture and stratigraphy from varying periods. Therefore, archaeological trenches can become extremely complex very quickly, with large amounts of data being recorded daily from different individuals. When this data is combined with data from other trenches, analysis and interpretation are intricate and complicated. Therefore, methodical, clear and concise note-taking is critical to keep data organized and coherent so it can be synthesized, analyzed, and interpreted individually and jointly with data from individual or multiple trenches. Thus, field notebooks are critical tools for archaeologists to interpret and create knowledge about the past.  

Our discussion posts mimic how archaeologists record evidence/data and synthesize it into a homogenous corpus that reflects all the work undertaken during a field season. A shared Obsidian.md vault for the class will be created and in the vault will be designated files for your group project. All students can see and access these files, so be considerate and **do not tamper with files and notes that do not belong to you.** I will monitor student note creation while creating additional instructor notes to stimulate dialogue and support your learning. Each week, students are required to submit one discussion post and a minimum of two reply posts in Obsidian.md based on the themes for that week (See week one Obsidian lesson overview). Templates will be provided for your posts in the Templates folder in the community vault, as the consistent recording of our ideas is important for the final outcome of this project. Each week you will be given a prompt on which to base your discussion post. Each post will contain a maximum of 400 words (unless otherwise specified) and include relevant citations. Citing is extremely important for this project, and you must provide a minimum of two citations per discussion post and reply post.  The citations have two purposes. First, demonstrate and give credit to the sources that aided in generating your thoughts and ideas. Secondly, it is a surprise to be revealed in our final week.

You will then link your posts to two of your peers' posts with a reply on why you created this link. Replies will be no more than 150 words. **There is no maximum amount of replies,** and be sure your replies contribute in a rigorous scholarly manner. One reply is to be linked to a member of your group and one to a student outside your group. These posts are meant to stimulate dialogue and collaboration with your colleagues in and outside your groups (just like if you were working in different trenches at the same archaeological site). **They are not meant to be heavily critical or disparaging.** At the beginning of week two, you will be divided into groups and begin collaborating and developing strategies to analyze, interpret and formulate hypotheses from your group's ever-evolving Obsidian.md repository. This exercise aims to force you to think critically about what you and your peers record as data/evidence and how your classmates link ideas together.  This is an exercise about significance claims. What is identified and considered as data, and what is not? The goal is not to find a correct or definitive answer but to understand the processes involved in collecting and interpreting archaeological data. Furthermore, discussions are meant to support and inform your final project.

### Podcasts:

The podcasts assigned are meant to stimulate dialogue and expose you to the differences between reading academic work and listening to academics talk about their work. The objective is to get students to think critically about the in-between spaces of academic and public history, and where these two fields intersect. In particular, we focus on the podcast *Byzantium and Friends*. Throughout the course, we will discuss the podcast's themes, target audiences and whether podcasts are a useful medium to present academic work to the public. Podcasts are considered part of the reading requirements for the course, and students are expected to come prepared to discuss the assigned podcasts in class (or discussion posts) when required. Other podcasts have been provided on the resources page for comparison but are not mandatory unless stipulated. 

### Tutorial Assessments:

There are three tutorial weeks for the course. Each tutorial draws from the previous week's themes and gives students the opportunity for experiential and collaborative learning objectives. For each tutorial, students will work with their assigned groups and discuss, collaborate and accomplish the week's assigned deliverable tasks. Tutorial one (Week 4) gets students to focus on problematizing the term "Byzantine" and "Byzantium" to identify the Eastern Roman Empire on the public-facing side of museum websites. The goal is for students to understand the complexities of accurately representing ancient identities in a consumable manner for the public while avoiding the colonial ghosts which linger in Byzantine studies. 

Tutorial number two (Week 8) focuses on data collection, specifically how we source, interpret and record data into large databases for current and future use. The objective is for students to excavate data from web-based coin databases, think through which coins they will document in their group databases and why they chose the "identifiers" in their databases. The tutorial's goal is to provide students with the necessary skills to navigate large databases, interpret legacy data and provide data for their group's final project. 

The final tutorial's objective (Week 12) is to support students and their data analysis. In other words, how to synthesize the data collected in week eight into a readable and useable narrative for museum curators to draw from when creating museum coin exhibits. Students play both roles, as the tutorial's goal is to simulate the dialogues between scholars when creating historical narratives for public consumption. Students will draw from their group's Obsidian notes to support their analysis and the final project.

### Final Assessment:

Your final project is to create a visual narrative about an assemblage of coins that enchanted you. This project is a team project meant to simulate preparing a virtual exhibition. Each group will select six coins (that's two coins per person) to present in their virtual exhibit. You will also collaborate with the other groups to ensure no one is presenting the same coins (I will create a sheet for you to record which coins you have selected). We will be utilizing [Mural](https://www.getmural.io/docs/intro/) to create our final project. You will utilize the tutorials, Obsidian vault, and discussions to inform your final project. You will present your Mural project via the internet, which will count as your group presentation component for grading purposes. Further details are to be discussed in class. 

### Addendum:

Do you and your group have an idea for a different final project you would like to explore rather than Mural? Awesome! Pitch it to me. I am open to allowing alternative projects for this class. Nothing is really set in stone. It's *Digital* and malleable. **However**, alternative projects need to be proposed to me by **week seven**. This is to ensure that your group have formulated a plan and know your goals in order to maximize the tutorial in week eight.
