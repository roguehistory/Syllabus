### An Instructor's Brief Anecdote:

This course is inspired by my experiences and research in Athens, Greece, during the summer of 2022. I was researching Byzantine (Eastern Roman Empire) coins at the Athenian Agora as well as how coins were curated and exhibited in Greek Museums. I focused on how the museums used coins to present and represent Byzantine identity to the public. It was no surprise to see the coins displayed in glass cases with brief explanations next to them. However, what was surprising was the stark contrast between who visited the Numismatic Museum of Athens, the Byzantine and Christian Museum (Athens), the Museum of Byzantine Culture (Thessaloniki), and the fairly new, architecturally stunning, bright, spacious, and interactive, Acropolis Museum in Athens.  Can you guess which museum had more people present?  The Acropolis Museum. I asked myself, what was it about the Acropolis museum, besides its modernist architecture, that brought people into it by the thousands? Was it Greek antiquity? No, there were Roman exhibits too. Why was this museum so attractive compared to the other museums? Maybe it was the public access to the excavated site underneath the museum. Were the narratives told through the exhibits more engaging, interactive, and enchanting then Byzantine history and material culture? No, it can't be. Byzantine history and archaeology are super cool...but is it enchanting? Do you even know who the Byzantines are?
