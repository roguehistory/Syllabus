## Tutorial

### What To Do With All That Data?

Our final tutorial will explore how to manage, organize and interpret the data collected from week eight and the links and connections made from your discussion posts and mind-maps in Obsidian. We will discuss network analysis and how we can apply the Obsidian graph view to inform the construction of your digital exhibit. We will critically assess the data you collected in week eight and discuss the problems with the use of legacy data in your analysis. Furthermore, we will debate the implications of too much data and how this may impact your analysis. Can there be too much data and how you will relay all this data we collected over the semester into an understandable, consumable, visual, and enchanting narrative for the public? Lastly, my secret Obsidian.md objective will be revealed.  

##### Deliverable: 

The deliverable for this week will be assessed on your ability to manage your data collection in class with your groups. By the end of the week, your group will have completed a proposed outline for your virtual exhibit via the mind map tool Canvas by Sunday, 11:59 PM. Using the [[DiscussionTemplate]] discuss how the readings informed your analysis of the data and the methods you use to present an enchanting digital exhibit.  How did you organize and mitigate all the data collected? How did you adjust your analysis to account for any embedded biases from either the data's source or your own? I will review your mind maps and provide suggestions and feedback on your proposed exhibit in the next class.

##### Discussion:

For your last discussion post, discuss how obsidian informed your final project and if you found the software pedagogically useful to your learning experience. Don't be shy. Tell me the good, the bad, and the ugly. I can handle it. 
**Make sure to cite your sources and reply to two different discussion posts from classmates who are not in your group.**
