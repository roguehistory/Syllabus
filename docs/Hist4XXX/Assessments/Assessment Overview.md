## Assessments: 
### Overview:
The course will be evaluated on participation, weekly discussion posts using Obsidian.md, three tutorial assignments (Weeks 4, 8, and 12), and a final project where students, in their designated groups, will create a virtual/digital essay with Mural.io. The tutorial assessments will focus on the process, not the outcome, while the final assignment focuses on the process and the end product. Your weekly discussion posts are meant to inform your tutorials and final project through collaborative processes with your fellow students. There is no final exam or mid-term. 

### Grading:

##### Participation: 10%
Constructive participation in class is what I am looking for. Come prepared, discuss readings and podcasts, and voila, you've participated. 

##### Discussion Posts: 30%
Discussions posts will be evaluated based on 1) the quality and clarity of content, 2) a minimum of two replies each week, 3) how you are linking your ideas, 4) citation requirements, and 5) your group's Canvas mind map. Each week is worth 2.5% of the total grade. 

##### Tutorials: 30%
Each tutorial is worth 10% of your total mark for a total of 30%.

##### Final Project: 30%
The final project will be evaluated on both individual and group criteria. 10% based on your individual contribution to the final project. 10% on the project's content and 10% based on the presentation of the project by your group.
