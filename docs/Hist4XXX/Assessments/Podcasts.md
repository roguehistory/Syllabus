### Podcasts:

The podcasts assigned are meant to stimulate dialogue and expose you to the differences between reading academic work and listening to academics talk about their work. The objective is to get students to think critically about the in-between spaces of academic and public history, and where these two fields intersect. In particular, we focus on the podcast *Byzantium and Friends*. Throughout the course, we will discuss the podcast's themes, target audiences and whether podcasts are a useful medium to present academic work to the public. Podcasts are considered part of the reading requirements for the course, and students are expected to come prepared to discuss the assigned podcasts in class (or discussion posts) when required. Other podcasts have been provided on the resources page for comparison but are not mandatory unless stipulated.
