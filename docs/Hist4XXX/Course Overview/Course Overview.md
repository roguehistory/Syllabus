## Course Overview:
### An Instructor's Brief Anecdote:

This course is inspired by my experiences and research in Athens, Greece, during the summer of 2022. I was researching Byzantine (Eastern Roman Empire) coins at the Athenian Agora as well as how coins were curated and exhibited in Greek Museums. I focused on how the museums used coins to present and represent Byzantine identity to the public. It was no surprise to see the coins displayed in glass cases with brief explanations next to them. However, what was surprising was the stark contrast between who visited the Numismatic Museum of Athens, the Byzantine and Christian Museum (Athens), the Museum of Byzantine Culture (Thessaloniki), and the fairly new, architecturally stunning, bright, spacious, and interactive, Acropolis Museum in Athens.  Can you guess which museum had more people present?  The Acropolis Museum. I asked myself, what was it about the Acropolis museum, besides its modernist architecture, that brought people into it by the thousands? Was it Greek antiquity? No, there were Roman exhibits too. Why was this museum so attractive compared to the other museums? Maybe it was the public access to the excavated site underneath the museum. Were the narratives told through the exhibits more engaging, interactive, and enchanting then Byzantine history and material culture? No, it can't be. Byzantine history and archaeology are super cool...but is it enchanting? Do you even know who the Byzantines are?

### Course Description: 

This is a course about the power of narrative, knowledge creation, and the digital methods used to facilitate such endeavours to create enchantment around the archaeology of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire within the public sphere. Specifically, we will explore how narrative and knowledge is constructed around Byzantine coins from excavation to exhibition, and how museums use these coins to represent Byzantine history and identity for public consumption. The central question I want to explore in this course is: How can we make Byzantine coins more accessible and enchanting for the public?  I want us to explore this question by integrating digital methods into our analysis. However, you may be asking, why bother going through all this effort to make Byzantine coins more engaging, accessible and enchanting? A coin is a coin, right?

Nope!

Besides my personal bias, coins have been, and continue to be, to some degree, isolated from historical and archaeological narratives in museums. Each ancient and medieval coin is unique. They were hand-struck which makes no two coins alike. Furthermore, Byzantine coins are tangible objects that link our modern world to the ancient and medieval world as many of our modern coin designs are inspired by Greek and Roman coins (Balaskas 2019). Unfortunately, Byzantine coins have generally been presented to the public in a disenchanted manner; distant, dis-engaged, sensorially abstract, void of their primary form of engagement: Touch and Feel. The sensorial is very much removed and this distorts the affective nature Byzantine coins have on the public. We generally display coins behind glass-encased exhibits (with written descriptions either next to the coin or on panel outside of the display) forbidding the experience of touch and, in many situations, in order to see the intricate artistic, linguistic, and iconographic details you must lean in as close as possible to view the coins on display. But not too close where you set off the alarms (I did this at the Museum of Byzantine Culture in Thessaloniki). Because of the way coins are presented, inevitably, we do not see many of the finer details altogether. Is it any wonder that the monotonous, chronologically ordered, sensorily-abstract methods used to exhibit many Byzantine coins has created an aura of disenchantment. 

To address the above problems, we need to understand how Byzantine history developed as a discipline and how coins, within this disciplinary framework, are excavated, analyzed, curated, represented and presented for public consumption in museums. After which, we will explore different digital methodologies to (re)approach Byzantine coins in, I hope, a more enchanting manner. The objective of the course is to expose students, in a pedagogical environment that does not frown upon failure but openly embraces its inevitability for its learning potential, to a variety of skills and tools to critically assess the intersection of Byzantine history, archaeology, digital humanities and numismatics within public history. The goal is to provide students with the necessary skills that will allow them to critically (re)think how we engage the public with Byzantine coins in public institutions and digital spaces. Furthermore, we address these questions through collaborative digital means, but before we get into the meat of the course, you may be saying: Back that train up. What is enchantment? 

### Enchantment: Not just a Disney fairy tale.

Enchantment is a 'state of wonder,'' an emotive experience that is generated deliberately or by surprise through the affective nature of the sensorial experience (Bennett 2001; Perry 2006; Graham 2020). During our exploration of Byzantine history, archaeology, numismatics and public history we will note that discussion surrounding *enchantment* in Byzantine studies is...lacking. Why? One answer may be how archaeologists and numismatists present and discuss our respective fields. Shawn Graham writes, ‘The serious face of archaeology we present to the public is so lifeless: how can we expect government and the public to be excited about our work if we ourselves give every indication of not being excited either?’” (Graham 2020: 4). In other words, unless scholars get more excited, evocative, animated, provide alternative mediums for narrative creation, create opportunities for public engagement, collaboration, and interaction, and a little less disparaging about how we represent our work to the public, we may indeed be able to create enchantment for and with the public at-large. Graham's observation is pointedly true for Byzantine coins but I am not saying (and I am sure Graham is not) that we go all *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* on the archaeology of Byzantine coins. That would require time travel. The question, rather, is what processes and mediums should be explored to facilitate enchantment around Byzantine coins and what could enchantment do for the study of Byzantine history? Enchantment, I argue, can present new, innovative and evocative affective methodologies to critically (re)engage with archaeological legacy data and contemporary materials for creating enchanting narratives that will stimulate wonder and aura around the public facing presentation of Byzantine history.
